# Introduction

> Under the Allee effect, the growth of a population is reduced at low
> densities. Using the strong and the weak Allee effect models as indicated
> below, find the equilibrium through calculations, then confirm these using a
> graphical technique. Finally, write an ordinary differential equations model
> for the strong Allee effect, and verify that populations starting on different
> sides of the equilibrium do end up where they are predicted.

## Model description and justification

<!-- Use the two models for the strong and weak Allee effect, respectively -->

$$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}n = n\times r\times \left(\frac{n}{A}-1\right)\times \left(1-\frac{n}{K}\right)$$

$$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}n = n\times \frac{r}{K}N^2\times \left(1-\frac{n}{K}\right)$$

## Model analysis

Let's find the equilibrium of this model through calculations. To achieve that, we will find when the 
equilibrium of each model is equal to zero. 

# Strong Allee effect
The equation for the strong Allee effect is the following:
$$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}n = n\times r\times \left(\frac{n}{A}-1\right)\times \left(1-\frac{n}{K}\right)$$
To find the equilibrum we will search the values for which :
$$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}n = 0$$
$$\0 = n\times r\times \left(\frac{n}{A}-1\right)\times \left(1-\frac{n}{K}\right)$$


# Weak Allee effect
The equation for the strong Allee effect is the following:
$$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}n = n\times \frac{r}{K}N^2\times \left(1-\frac{n}{K}\right)$$
To find the equilibrum we will search the values for which :
$$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}n = 0$$
$$\0 = n\times \frac{r}{K}N^2\times \left(1-\frac{n}{K}\right)$$
